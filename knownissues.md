### Unavailable Videos ###

Videos that have expired (Hulu) or are in the Saved Instant (Netflix) queue
will still appear in the Understudy menu, but will fail to play when selected.

### Full Screen ###

In Netflix, video will be enlarged to fill the screen, but is not using the fullscreen functionality of the video player. The slider and controls will still appear at the bottom of the screen.

In Hulu, the player cannot current fullscreen.

### Login ###

Viewing video may require that you be logged into a particular site through Safari.
This may be true for all video (Netflix) or only some (e.g. mature content on Hulu).
Understudy does not currently determine whether you are logged into a site,
nor will it log you in automatically.

### Safari ###

In order to log into a site, you must use Safari ([issue 6](https://code.google.com/p/understudy/issues/detail?id=6)).
In addition, there has been a report that Understudy will crash if Safari is not installed ([issue 4](https://code.google.com/p/understudy/issues/detail?id=4)), or when using Safari 4 ([issue 72](https://code.google.com/p/understudy/issues/detail?id=72)).
